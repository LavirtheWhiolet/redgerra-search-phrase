### Microsoft Windows XP and above ###

Download Ruby installer from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/. Version 1.9.3 or above is required. Run the installer.

Download Development Kit from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ which corresponds to the Ruby version you have installed previously. Unpack it into the directory with the installed Ruby.

In Ubuntu (http://www.ubuntu.com/), Debian (https://www.debian.org/) you give the command (as root):

    apt-get install ruby ruby-dev
