Step 1

First you need to install Ruby (http://ruby-lang.org) and dev-kit for it.

### Microsoft Windows XP and above ###

Download Ruby installer from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/. Version 1.9.3 or above is required. Run the installer.

Download Development Kit from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ which corresponds to the Ruby version you have installed previously. Unpack it into the directory with the installed Ruby.

### GNU/Linux ###

In Ubuntu (http://www.ubuntu.com/), Debian (https://www.debian.org/) you give the command (as root):

    apt-get install ruby ruby-dev

Step 2

You need to install Ruby gems (http://rubygems.org) required by this software. In MS Windows command prompt or in other OS's terminal give the following command (as root or as administrator):

    gem install bundler
    bundle install
